##Usage Notes for Application Services  
___

**App Killer** will quit any application you choose. I have this bound to a key combination, and find that I use it saves me from having to "activate" applications that are not in focus just so I can quit them. There is a slight issue with apps that run multiple similarly-named processes (like Google Chrome) but otherwise, it is effective.  
<BR>
**App Launcher** is a silly application launcher that was written more as proof-of-concept than an actual utility (since you can use spotlight or any of the million fully-featured application launchers that exist), but I had fun writing it and it spawned the **App Killer** script. Side Note: **App Launcher** Will also quit applications if you add ``kill`` before the application name (e.g. ``kill TextEdit``).  
<BR>

**App Shutdown** Provides a timer with which you can shutdown applications (obvs), just in case you get annoyed at yourself for never remembering to close iTunes (or whatever the case may be).  
<BR>
**App Watcher** is a script that allows you to set an application to watch, wait for that application to launch, and then open a file or another application. This could be a little more robust, but it is another proof-of-concept type script that I wrote for fun.
